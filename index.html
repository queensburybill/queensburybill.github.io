          <!-- The reason I'm using inline SVG files instead of importing them is so I have access to the 
               "fill" properties for the "paths" and "polygons" in CSS. -->
  
          <!-- If you have SVG elements of different shapes, AND you want them to be scalable when the container 
               scales, BUT you don't want them to be sized according to the container (for example if the viewbox
               is cropped exactly to the image dimensions: a wide image set to "width=80%" will be much smaller 
               than a narrow image set to the same width), THEN you MUST make your viewbox the same for ALL images 
               (it should be a square based on the largest dimenision found in the group - either width or height). 
               THEN you can use that to set your scale relative to the container (ie: svg { width: 80% } ). 
               This techinque is easily accomplished in Illustrator by centering all the images on the same sized
               artboard before saving as an SVG. -->
